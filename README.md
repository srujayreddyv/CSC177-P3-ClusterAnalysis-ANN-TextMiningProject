# CSC177- Project 4: Cluster Analysis, ANN &amp; Text Mining Project (Fall 2023)

## Overview
Welcome to our CSC177 project repository, where we delve into Cluster Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Text Mining. Our team, Team Challengers (23), has diligently applied sophisticated data science techniques to analyze and interpret complex datasets.

## Project Structure
This repository is organized into distinct Jupyter notebooks and a final report, each addressing specific components of our comprehensive project.

### Notebooks
1. **Clustering Analysis (`CSC177_P4_Clustering.ipynb`):**
   - Implementation of KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering.
   - Analysis using the Elbow Method.
   - Exploration of various clustering approaches including Single Link, Complete Link, and Average Link.

2. **Text Mining and ANN (`CSC177_P4_TextMiningAndANN.ipynb`):**
   - Advanced data preprocessing techniques.
   - Application of TF-IDF Vectorization in text mining.
   - Development and training of Artificial Neural Networks.

### Final Report
- **`CSC177-Project4Report.pdf`**: This report provides a detailed account of our methodologies, findings, and visualizations in clustering, text mining, and ANN.
